// Package imageupgrade replaces the node's UKI without touching its identity
// (#208).
//
// Until now the only way to put a new CryptOS build on a node was to
// re-provision it, which reformats the state partition and destroys the CA key
// with it. That made every OS change an irreversible ceremony, and it is what
// blocks putting RSA CA support onto an already-established node.
//
// The disk layout already separates the two concerns. internal/install lays out
// an EFI System Partition plus a cryptos-state partition, and the root
// filesystem is an immutable SquashFS carried inside the UKI on the ESP. So an
// upgrade is: write a new UKI to the ESP and reboot. The LUKS state partition --
// CA key, etcd, identity, issued history -- is never opened.
//
// # Two independent checks, neither pretending to be the other
//
// The firmware is the authority on whether an image may boot: it verifies the
// UKI's Authenticode signature against the Secure Boot db certificate enrolled
// on that machine. Nothing here can weaken or substitute for that.
//
// This package performs a second, earlier check: a detached release signature
// over the image bytes, verified against a release certificate the running
// image already carries. Its purpose is to refuse to *write* an image we cannot
// attribute, rather than to decide bootability. Without it, an admin-authorized
// call could park an unverifiable image on the ESP; the firmware would refuse to
// boot it and the node would need physical recovery, which is a denial of
// service dressed as an upgrade.
//
// A pure-Go Authenticode verifier is deliberately not attempted. sbverify is a
// build-host tool and is not in the rootfs, and a hand-rolled PE signature
// parser in the trusted path of a CA is a poor trade against a detached
// signature that is a dozen lines of standard library.
//
// # Slot layout
//
// The firmware boots the removable-media fallback path, with no NVRAM boot
// entry (see internal/install), so activation is a rename rather than an
// efibootmgr call:
//
//	EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI       the image the firmware boots
//	EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.PREV.EFI  the previous image, kept bootable for recovery
//	EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.NEW.EFI   the incoming image, mid-write
//
// The previous image is retained on purpose: the thing being upgraded is the
// node's only management surface, so an upgrade that boots to nothing must be
// recoverable without a site visit.
